The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a federal law that permits individuals to request access to federal agency information and documents, except for records protected from disclosure by FOIA.

# Make a FOIA Request

Before submitting a FOIA request, please be sure to thoroughly browse NCD's website, including About Us, Newsroom,Progress Reports, Publications & Policy Briefs, Meetings & Events, and the NCD Policy Areas, which contain extensive information already available to the public.

When submitting a FOIA request to NCD, the requestor should:

*     State the request is being made under the Freedom of Information Act;
*     Be as specific as possible in identifying requested records;
*     Include his or her name, address, and phone number.

NCD will make every effort to respond to FOIA requests as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.

NCD's Freedom of Information Officer is Amy Nicholas, Attorney Advisor:

# FOIA e-Library

NCD strives to proactively publish as much information about NCD and our work processes as possible. That way, information that might be requested via a FOIA request can be readily found by any member of the public on our website, but not necessarily in this e-library. Examples of available documents on our website are: NCD Bylaws; Performance and Results Act Reports ; Congressional Budget Justification Reports; Financial Audit Reports; NCD strategic plan; Letters to stakeholders; NCD reports and NCD’s FOIA policy and procedures for requesters. While NCD publications are posted throughout the NCD.gov website, non-NCD documents, such as official government responses to NCD letters, will be posted here to the NCD FOIA e-Library. If you need help to determine whether the information you seek is posted to our website please contact NCD’s FOIA Public Liaison, Amy Nicholas, at 202-272-2008 or [anicholas@ncd.gov](mailto:anicholas@ncd.gov?subject=FOIA).
