# Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q:** *What is NCD?*

NCD is an independent federal agency and is composed of 15 members appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. It provides advice to the President, Congress, and executive branch agencies to promote policies, programs, practices, and procedures that guarantee equal opportunity for all individuals with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability and to empower individuals with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society.

### **Q:** *How can I become a Council Member of NCD?*

Pursuant to NCD's authorizing statute, Title IV of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the President of the United States selects Council Members of NCD after soliciting recommendations from representatives of organizations representing a broad range of individuals with disabilities, and from organizations interested in individuals with disabilities. NCD members are people with disabilities, parents or guardians of people with disabilities, or other people who have substantial knowledge or experience relating to disability policy or programs.

NCD members are appointed to represent people with disabilities, national organizations concerned with people with disabilities, providers and administrators of services to people with disabilities, people engaged in conducting medical or scientific research relating to people with disabilities, business concerns, and labor organizations. A majority of NCD members are people with disabilities. NCD members are broadly representative of minority and other individuals and groups.
