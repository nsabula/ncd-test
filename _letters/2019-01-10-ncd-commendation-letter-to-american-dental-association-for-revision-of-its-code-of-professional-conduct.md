Dear Drs. Herman and Crowley,

I am writing you today to commend the American Dental Association (ADA) on following through with NCD’s recommendation that the ADA revise its *Principles of Ethics and Code of Professional Conduct* to better reflect the rights of patients with disabilities in providers’ patient selection (sections 4.A and 4.A.1.).

The ADA Code serves as the compass used by dental care providers across the nation, as well as the standard on which many State laws are based, hence this decision by the ADA no doubt represents a leap in the right direction toward equal access to care for people with disabilities that cannot afford to be turned away by their care providers. This revision also represents a step towards full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency as envisioned by laws including the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and NCD’s own mission.

Again, NCD commends you and, on behalf of the millions of Americans with disabilities, we thank you for taking this important step toward improving the overall health care of this often underserved population.

Sincerely,

Neil Romano\
Chairman
