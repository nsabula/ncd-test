There's no limit to what people with disabilities can do. Now, that includes saving, too. Come and find out if you or a member of your family is eligible to participate in the ABLE program in Nevada. ABLE accounts allow individuals with disabilities the opportunity to save and invest money without losing eligibility for certain public benefits programs, like Medicaid, SSI or SSDI.  Earnings in ABLE accounts are not subject to federal income tax, so long as funds are spent on qualified disability expenses.  Deposits can be invested in different options chosen by the participant.  While participants can still withdraw and spend money as needed, an ABLE account also allows money to grow for when it is needed for disability expenses.
