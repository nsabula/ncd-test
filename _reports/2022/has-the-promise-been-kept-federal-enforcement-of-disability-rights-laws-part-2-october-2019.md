**SCOPE AND PURPOSE:** In this year's annual progress report, the Council revisits the NCD report *[Promises to Keep: A Decade of Federal Enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act](https://ncd.gov/publications/2000/June272000)*, released in 2000. The second in a two-part series, following last year’s *[Has the Promise Been Kept? Federal Enforcement of Disability Rights Laws](https://ncd.gov/progressreport-publications/2018/has-promise-been-kept)* assesses the progress made by the U.S. Departments of Justice (DOJ), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement and enforce federal disability rights laws. This report assesses how these agencies implement and enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act and other federal disability rights laws and programs, offers key findings from this assessment, and concludes by offering recommendations to enhance the agencies' investigative and compliance efforts.
