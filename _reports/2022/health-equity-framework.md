It is the product of a year&rsquo;s worth of strategic outreach; consultation with a &quot;dream team&quot; of 14 academics, medical professionals, and others who have dedicated their lives to addressing the health disparities of people with disabilities; and literature review.</p><p>NCD&rsquo;s framework begins with four core areas that NCD views as foundational for achieving health equity for people with disabilities. It is followed by numerous additional components that were identified by disability community leaders as being of critical importance.</p><p>These foundational planks, which lay the structural framework for a comprehensive guide to policymakers to improving health equity for people with disabilities, are as follows:</p><ol><li>Designating people with disabilities as a Special Medically Underserved Population (SMUP) under the Public Health Services Act;</li><li>Requiring comprehensive disability clinical-care curricula in all US medical, nursing and other healthcare professional schools and requiring disability competency education and training of medical, nursing and other healthcare professionals;</li><li>Requiring the use of accessible medical and diagnostic equipment; and</li><li>&nbsp;Improving data collection concerning healthcare for people with disabilities across the lifespan.</li></ol><p><strong>RELATED:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="http://ncd.gov/newsroom/2021/vision-and-priority-statement-ncd-chairman-gallegos">Vision and Priority Statement of Chairman Gallegos</a> (2021)</li><li><a href="http://ncd.gov/progressreport/2021/2021-progress-report"><em>The Impact of COVID-19 on People with Disabilities</em></a> (2021)</li><li><a href="http://ncd.gov/publications/2021/enforceable-accessible-medical-equipment-standards"><em>Enforceable Accessible Medical Equipment Standards: A Necessary Means to Address the Health Care Needs of People with Mobility Disabilities</em></a> (2021)</li><li><a href="http://ncd.gov/publications/2009/Sept302009"><em>The Current State of Health Care for People with Disabilities&nbsp;</em></a>(2009)&nbsp;</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Learn more about NCD&#39;s Health Equity Framework during a Stakeholder Call via Zoom:</strong></span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><div>The National Council on Disability--an independent federal agency--offers a webinar discussing the release of their new Health Equity Framework.<br />February 23, 20222- 2:45 p.m. (ET)</div><div>SPEAKERS:</div><ul><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Andr√©s Gallegos, Chairman, NCD</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Rick Rader, MD, Council Member, NCD</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Lisa Iezzoni, MD, Harvard School of Medicine</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Neil Romano, Council Member, NCD</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp;Moderated by: Priya Chandan, MD, PhD, MPH, Clinical Associate Professor, University of Louisville School of Medicine</li></ul></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Registration on our Eventbrite page is not required for attendance but appreciated.<br />&nbsp;</div><div><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ncd-health-equity-framework-national-stakeholder-call-tickets-268930387027">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ncd-health-equity-framework-national-stakeholder-call-tickets-268930387027</a></div><div>&nbsp;</div><h5><span style="font-size:10px;"><b style="color: rgb(32, 31, 30); font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Web (West European)&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;"><span lang="EN-US" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline;">ACCOMMODATIONS:&nbsp;</span></b><span lang="EN-US" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(32, 31, 30);">CART and ASL interpreters will be provided.
