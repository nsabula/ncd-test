For eighty-three years, this exemption from minimum wage protections has been used to legally pay people with disabilities subminimum wages.</p><p>In 2012, NCD published our investigative findings in our report, &ldquo;<em>Subminimum Wage and Supported Employment</em>,&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> and recommended a systems-change approach to phasing out the 14(c)-waiver program. This investigation followed a thorough review of national research on subminimum wage employment, including &ldquo;sheltered workshops,&rdquo; as well as site visits across the country to seek out the views and experiences of workers with disabilities, family members, workshop operators, supported employment providers, and policymakers. As a result of that investigation, NCD reached the following conclusions:</p><ul><li>Sheltered workshops are ineffective at transitioning individuals with disabilities to integrated employment;</li><li>Only around 5% of sheltered workshops employees left to take a job in the community, although workshops are supposed to be a time-limited path to competitive employment;</li><li>There is no higher rate of employment for individuals who undergo &ldquo;training&rdquo; in a sheltered workshop versus individuals who go directly into supported employment;</li><li>95% of all workers with disabilities being paid less than minimum wage under the 14(c) program were employed by sheltered workshops; and</li><li>Employees receiving supported employment services generate lower cumulative costs than employees receiving sheltered workshop services, and the cost-trend of supported employees shifts downward over time, while the opposite is the case for individuals receiving services in sheltered workshops.</li></ul><p>Today, 14(c) waivers symbolize a policy relic of the past that needs to be phased out. 14(c) was enacted during the 1930s New Deal era, during a time when the country struggled to find opportunities for employment for people with disabilities in a primarily industrial and agricultural economic system. It was enacted at a time where both the charity and medical models of disability were the predominant social constructs by which people with disabilities were viewed. It was further enacted against the backdrop of the Eugenics movement in the United States and the prevalence of the Ugly Laws, which we reference to illuminate the then prevalent negative and hostile societal views of people with disabilities.</p><p>14(c) waivers created a separate path in society for people with disabilities in federally sanctioned segregated work settings that paid subminimum wages. Since then, societal views of people with disabilities have evolved and Congress has taken several steps to recognize civil rights protections for people with disabilities through the passage of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000, and most recently the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. Collectively, they declare and articulate a national policy to empower people with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion through opportunities for competitive integrated employment. The continued existence of 14(c) waivers is antithetical to that declaration.</p><p>We look forward to working with the sponsors of this bill and other policymakers in any capacity desired to ensure a move away from subminimum wages consistent with modern national disability policy and the successful transition of people with disabilities into competitive integrated jobs.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Andr√©s J.
