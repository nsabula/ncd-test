          NCD has a proud history. First established as a small advisory Council
          within the Department of Education in 1978, NCD was transformed into
          an independent agency in 1984 and charged with reviewing all federal
          disability programs and policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1986, NCD recommended enactment of an Americans with Disabilities
          Act, and then drafted the first version of the bill introduce in the
          House and Senate in 1988.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since enactment of the ADA in 1990, NCD has continued to play a
          leading role in analyzing the needs of people with disabilities,
          crafting policy solutions, and advising the President and Congress.
